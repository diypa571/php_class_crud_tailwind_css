So here Create a REST API in PHP with MySQL
I will explain here simply  how to create a REST API in PHP with MySQL.
 
What is REST API and  how it works??
 
The Re stands for Representational
ST stands for State Transfer.
Ok, REST API is used for creating web services that can be accessed online, the current crud php application, we can use REST API for 
Insert, Select, Update and Delete. 
For REST API we use HTTP methods for example GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.


GET – To retrieve information, From the URL as parameters
POST – To create a new data record, will send data in the background 
PUT – To update existing data record.
DELETE – To delete data record


The REST API, we  can retrieve information, get  responses in a JSON

In php we can use the function json_encode() to  encode an array to JSON format.

 
header("Content-Type:application/json"); 
if (isset($_GET['id']) && $_GET['id']!="") {
$userData['id'] = $res['id'];
$userData['name'] = $res['name'];
$userData['emaill'] = $res['email'];
$userData['username'] =  $res['username'];
$response["status"] = "true";
$response["message"] = "Customer Details";
$response["customers"] = $userData;
}
else{
$response["status"] = "false";
$response["message"] = "No data  is found!";
}
echo json_encode($response); 
exit;
